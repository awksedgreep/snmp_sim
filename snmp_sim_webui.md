# SnmpSim Web Management Interface

A comprehensive web-based management interface for SnmpSim virtual SNMP device simulation, implemented as a separate Phoenix application with SnmpSim as a dependency.

## Architecture Approach

**Separate Project Structure**: Clean separation between the core simulation engine (SnmpSim) and the web management interface, allowing for:
- Independent scaling and deployment
- Technology flexibility
- Clean API boundaries
- Production isolation capabilities
- Multiple interface support
